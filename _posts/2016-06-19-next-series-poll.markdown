I hope you've enjoyed reading 6-part series of articles named **"React and ES6"** (here is the
[link](http://egorsmirnov.me/2016/06/18/react-and-es2015-updated.html)). 

Initially, I didn't expect so much interest in such an articles. I am happy that you liked them.
*Thank you so much for all your feedback and contribution!*

Because writing of thorough technical blog posts requires enormous amounts of time,
I've decided to pick one of 4 various themes around React. And let you decide on what will be next.

So, if you interested in further articles, please vote below. I'll close the poll in a couple of months and start preparing.

Please let me know in comments if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you!
