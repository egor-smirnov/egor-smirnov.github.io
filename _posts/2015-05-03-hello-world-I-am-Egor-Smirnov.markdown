This is typical Hello World post.

As it usually happens, I planned to start blogging a lot of times before. Finally managed to do this.

Going to write mainly about JavaScript, maybe sometimes about node.js (which is quite new for me) and PHP (quite a lot of experience with this).

Also eventually wanted to try myself in micro-services architecture.
